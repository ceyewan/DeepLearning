### 加载数据集

```python
transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(size=(224, 224)),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5], std=[0.5, 0.5, 0.5])
])

dataset = ImageFolder('../input/surface-crack-detection', transform=transform)
full_ds = dataset
train_size = int(0.8 * len(full_ds))
validate_size = len(full_ds) - train_size
train_ds, test_ds = torch.utils.data.random_split(
    full_ds, [train_size, validate_size])
train_loader = DataLoader(
    dataset=train_ds, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=True)
test_loader = DataLoader(dataset=test_ds, batch_size=batch_size, shuffle=False)
```

1. 

```python
class Compose:
    """Composes several transforms together. This transform does not support torchscript.
    Please, see the note below.

    Args:
        transforms (list of ``Transform`` objects): list of transforms to compose.

    Example:
        >>> transforms.Compose([
        >>>     transforms.CenterCrop(10),
        >>>     transforms.PILToTensor(),
        >>>     transforms.ConvertImageDtype(torch.float),
        >>> ])

    .. note::
        In order to script the transformations, please use ``torch.nn.Sequential`` as below.

        >>> transforms = torch.nn.Sequential(
        >>>     transforms.CenterCrop(10),
        >>>     transforms.Normalize((0.485, 0.456, 0.406), (0.229, 0.224, 0.225)),
        >>> )
        >>> scripted_transforms = torch.jit.script(transforms)

        Make sure to use only scriptable transformations, i.e. that work with ``torch.Tensor``, does not require
        `lambda` functions or ``PIL.Image``.

```

2. 

```python
class ToTensor:
    """Convert a ``PIL Image`` or ``numpy.ndarray`` to tensor. This transform does not support torchscript.

    Converts a PIL Image or numpy.ndarray (H x W x C) in the range
    [0, 255] to a torch.FloatTensor of shape (C x H x W) in the range [0.0, 1.0]
    if the PIL Image belongs to one of the modes (L, LA, P, I, F, RGB, YCbCr, RGBA, CMYK, 1)
    or if the numpy.ndarray has dtype = np.uint8

    In the other cases, tensors are returned without scaling.

    .. note::
        Because the input image is scaled to [0.0, 1.0], this transformation should not be used when
        transforming target image masks. See the `references`_ for implementing the transforms for image masks.

    """
```

3. 

```python
class Normalize(torch.nn.Module):
    """Normalize a tensor image with mean and standard deviation.
    This transform does not support PIL Image.
    Given mean: ``(mean[1],...,mean[n])`` and std: ``(std[1],..,std[n])`` for ``n``
    channels, this transform will normalize each channel of the input
    ``torch.*Tensor`` i.e.,
    ``output[channel] = (input[channel] - mean[channel]) / std[channel]``

    .. note::
        This transform acts out of place, i.e., it does not mutate the input tensor.

    Args:
        mean (sequence): Sequence of means for each channel.
        std (sequence): Sequence of standard deviations for each channel.
        inplace(bool,optional): Bool to make this operation in-place.
